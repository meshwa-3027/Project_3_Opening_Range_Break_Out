**INTRODUCTION**

  The Opening Range Breakout (ORB) Trading System is an automated trading solution designed to capitalize on price movements that occur after the market opens. This system integrates real-time market data, algorithmic trading logic, and automated order execution to implement a sophisticated intraday trading strategy. By leveraging the AliceBlue trading platform and Excel for data management, this project aims to provide traders with a powerful tool for executing ORB strategies efficiently and consistently.
